# CROP-PRODUCTION-PREDICTION
#OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
I worked on a crop production dataset, starting with cleaning and preprocessing the data using Python's Pandas library. After cleaning, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and patterns in the data. The cleaned dataset was then converted into a CSV file for creating a "Crops Productions Analysis Dashboard" in Power BI. Following the dashboard creation, I trained various regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost. After evaluating the performance of all models, Random Forest Regression yielded the best score. I saved the trained Random Forest model using Joblib and integrated it into a Streamlit application. The application, "Crops Production Prediction," allows users to predict crop production based on input data. The entire workflow from data analysis to model deployment in Streamlit was successfully completed, resulting in a functional crop production prediction system and dashboard for analysis.

#STEPS FOR THE PROJECT:
Step 1: Cleaned and preprocessed the crop dataset using Python Pandas.
Step 2: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Step 3: Converted the cleaned dataset into CSV for Power BI dashboard creation.
Step 4: Created the "Crops Productions Analysis Dashboard" in Power BI.
Step 5: Trained regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, XGBoost.
Step 6: Evaluated model performance and compared scores.
Step 7: Random Forest Regression produced the best score.
Step 8: Saved the Random Forest model using Joblib.
Step 9: Loaded the trained Random Forest model into a Streamlit app.
Step 10: Developed the "Crops Production Prediction" application in Streamlit.
